# 🌍 Gapminder Data Exploration and Visualization

This project explores the **Gapminder dataset**, which contains socioeconomic indicators such as **life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population** for countries across different continents between **1952 and 2007**.  

The goal is to practice **data analysis and visualization techniques** in Python using libraries like `pandas` and `seaborn`.
